running UCVM container on quakeworx platform as a juypter lab terminal

user id is ucvmuser

ucvmuser's home directory is at /home/ucvmuser, this is not preserved after session exits

relevant directory structure,
/dotlocal where anaconda is installed
/result where the resulting plots are stored, not preserved
/setup_ucvm a ucvm setup script
/target is the working target directory with plotting samples, 
         this is preserved after session exits

/app
/app/minicona3 contains miniconda3's src
/app/ucvm contains the installation of UCVM v22.7 and latest ucvm plotting utilities
/app/ucvm_plotting contains latest ucvm plotting utilities in anaconda3 mode


===== current running state ====

   -- moho generate docker instance
   -- laptop to build and run container
   -- expanse to convert from docker instance to singularity instance
   -- quakeworx to run the singularity container -- juypter lab terminal

   -> docker container on laptop
                1 userid,
                permission correct on ucvmuser directory
                current user id -- ucvmuser

       1st way:
         source /home/ucvmuser/app/ucvm/conf/ucvm_env.sh
         cd target and run the plotting scripts
       2nd way:
         source ./setup-ucvm
         run the plotting scripts
       3rd way:
         source ./.bashrc
         run the plotting scripts

   -> singualarity container running on quakeworx:
                2 userid - qwxdev, ucvmuser
                permission incorrect on ucvmuser directory
                current user id -- quakewx
