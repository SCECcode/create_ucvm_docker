===== current running state ====

   -- moho generate docker instance
   -- laptop to build and run container
   -- expanse to convert from docker instance to singularity instance
   -- quakeworx to run the singularity container -- juypter lab terminal

   -> docker container on laptop
                1 userid,
                permission correct on ucvmuser directory
                current user id -- ucvmuser

       1st way:
         source /home/ucvmuser/app/ucvm/conf/ucvm_env.sh
         cd target and run the plotting scripts
       2nd way:
         source ./setup-ucvm
         run the plotting scripts
       3rd way:
         source ./.bashrc
         run the plotting scripts

   -> singualarity container running on quakeworx:
